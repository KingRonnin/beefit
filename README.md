# Beefit
Capstone Project: Techno Necromancers

## Description
Health and Fitness App/Website
This app will track the end-userâ€™s progress throughout their fitness journey. The app/website will provide an analytics dashboard to get a quick lookup of their progress (and get an option to export the charts to do their own analytics on raw data). The app/website will offer writing tools where they can record or type in whatever they desire; person blogs, shower thoughts, or diary. The app/website will also provide a weekly calendar so that the end-user will know what is going on in the up-coming days (These will be personally imputed by the end-user).
